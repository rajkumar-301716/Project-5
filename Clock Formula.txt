1st Formula : ( For hour Hand )
12hr = 360 degree
1hr = 360 / 12 => 30 degree
So it becomes ,
 hour rotation = 30 * htime + mtime / 2

2nd Formula : ( For minute Hand )
( For rotating from one number to other Ex: 12 to 1 )
60min = 30 degree
1 min = 1 / 2 degree 
m -> m / 2 degree rotation

So for circling from 12 to 12 again , 
60min -> 360 degree
1min -> 6 degree
So it becomes ,
minute rotation = 6 * mtime

3rd Formula : ( For second Hand )
So for circling from 12 to 12 again ,
60seconds -> 360 degree
1seconds -> 6 * stime
